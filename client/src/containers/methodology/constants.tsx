    question: "Overview of NCS funding study objectives",
    answer:
      "<p>NCS is poised to play a key role in helping the world reach net zero, with the <b>potential to contribute ~20-30% of what is needed to stabilize the climate by 2030</b>; however, there is still an outstanding question on how to fund NCS at scale – at the project level, sufficient catalytic capital is often hard to find, and at a global level, studies suggest that we need $400B/yr just to finance forestry pathways.</p><br/><p>The NCS funding landscape <b>varies significantly by country</b>, and adopting a country-level view is required to understand opportunities and identify actionable insights; Bain and TNC partnered for <b>4-months to survey the NCS funding landscape</b> in 10 focus countries to address the following focus areas:</p><br/><ul><li>Estimate of current NCS funding sources and challenges to achieving full potential</li><li>Opportunities to increase available NCS funding and funding effectiveness</li><li>Assessment of harmful economic activities (e.g., gov’t subsidies)</li><li>Identification of NCS funding implications, opportunities, & key priorities across focus countries</li></ul><br/><p>This study was conducted with Bain and CO.</p>",

    question: "Definition of NCS for this funding study",
    answer:
      "<div><p>While there is increased attention on the carbon potential of nature-based solutions (the restoration, management, or protection of nature), for the purpose of this study, we focus solely on NCS which are a <b>subset of NBS that increase carbon storage or avoid GHG emissions.</b></p> <br/> <p>Definition of NCS based on Nature4Climate, Nature Based Solutions Initiative, TNC NCS Handbook, and Griscom et. al 2017</p> <br/><p>If funding sources were ambiguous (e.g., a general environmental budget) but could include NCS, those funding sources were included, and funding amounts were ranged based on global proxies to estimate the amount strictly going to NCS.</p><>If there were programs that targeted conservation / biodiversity (where NCS is a co-benefit), those were excluded unless the <b>funding intent was for a NCS action or to sequester carbon via nature.</b></p></div>",

    question: "Scope of NCS funding for this study",
    answer:
      "<div><p>A broad approach was taken to identify addressable NCS funding, including dedicated flows categorized into <b>5 funding buckets</b>: public domestic funding, international aid, private funding, environmental & carbon markets, and philanthropy.</p><br/><p><b>Funds that didn’t impact NCS were excluded</b> (e.g., biodiversity funds); however, if the source was ambiguous (e.g., broad environmental spending), it was included with a percentage haircut to reflect the amount likely going to NCS.</p><br/><p> When identifying NCS funding opportunities, we similarly took a broad lens and included both upstream (e.g., policy mechanisms, changes to dedicated funding programs, gov’t subsidy reform) and <b>downstream</b> opportunities (e.g., promoting sustainable cattle ranching, developing a sustainable forest economy, eco-tourism) that had the potential to accelerate NCS impact.</p></div>",

    question: "Seven steps to estimate NCS funding available and assess funding opportunities",
    answer:
      "<div><ol><li><b>1. Define “Natural Climate Solutions”</b><ul><li>Include funding for NCS projects, i.e., actions that increase carbon storage or avoid GHG emissions<ul><li>NCS are a subset of NBS focused on carbon storage/GHG </li><li>NCS may have biodiversity co- benefits, but we do not split this out from a funding perspective in this study</li></ul></li><li>Per country, prioritize research on the top NCS pathways</li></ul></li><br/><br/><li><b>2. Define NCS funding taxonomy</b><ul><li>Focus on 5 key funding buckets:<ul><li>Public domestic</li><li>International aid</li><li>Private (debt, equity, etc.)</li><li>Env. & carbon markets</li><li>Philanthropy / donor funding</li></ul></li><li>Note: Taxonomy includes potential available funding that could be directed towards NCS</li></ul><br/><br/><li><b>3. Estimate available NCS funding today</b><ul><li>For each funding source, estimate the amount available for NCS through secondary literature; some global assumptions are made where country-specific data is unavailable.<ul><li>E.g., for domestic gov’t budget allocation, aggregate expenditure</li><li>E.g., for international aid, leverage OECD database and lit. search</li></ul></li></ul><br/><br/><li><b>4. Identify opportunities to increase funding</b><ul><li>Current funding effectiveness: Per funding source, assess level of funding efficiency (how funding is allocated & spent) through secondary literature, country team input</li><li>Identify biggest opportunities to increase funding efficiency</li><li> New funding sources: Compare current funding to funding taxonomy to identify sources Identify news of emerging funding sources (e.g., launch of a carbon market in 2025)</li></ul></li><br/><br/><li><b>5. Assess opportunities to reduce harmful economic activities</b><ul><li>Gov’t subsidies: For the top NCS pathways, identify sectors driving intensive land use / NCS- negative actions (e.g., agriculture)</li><li> Using gov’t reports, identify the budget for sector subsidies</li><li>Economic activity: For the top NCS pathways, identify industries driving intensive land use / NCS- negative actions. Identify market size of industries, and use sector averages to estimate COGs spend as a proxy for supply chain investments</li></ul></li><br/><br/><li><b>6. Size carbon abatement potential of current funding (optional)</b><ul><li>(Dependent on if high priority for the country team) Aggregate country-specific, regional, and global estimates of cost per pathway ($/ton)</li><li>Based on estimates, determine a reasonable range of cost/ton for that country per pathway</li><li>Using the N4C tool, estimate funding needed to reach the cost-effective potential Summarize implications and potential next steps</li></ul></li><br/><br/><li><b>7. Test key insights and implications from funding study with TNC country teams</b><ul><li>Prioritize opportunities for TNC to increase funding availability and effectiveness</li><li>Identify the roles of TNC country teams and how TNC Global can support to accelerate NCS impact</li></ul></li></ol></div>",
