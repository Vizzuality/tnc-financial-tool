    question:
      "REDD+ and LEAF overlapasLEAF is a funding mechanism for REDD+. Additionally,both REDD+ generally and LEAF specifically have market and non-market elements. Should the market elements be included under the carbon markets section?",
    answer:
      "<div><p>Yes, funding via a market mechanism would be included under the environmental and carbon markets bucket. However, the focus countries of this study have REDD+ payments through international aid (and therefore do not fall under market mechanisms). LEAF was not a current funding source for any of the focus countries in this phase and is thus not reflected in our study.</p></div>",

    question:
      "Are you going to align the taxonomy to reflect the 'gold standard'taxonomy for conservation finance?",
    answer:
      "<div><a href='#'>The NCS funding taxonomy</a> was developed in partnership with TNC Global and reviewed by membersof the TNC country teams. The taxonomy reflects some elements of the CFA taxonomy, but ultimately highlights the NCS funding sources that surfaced most frequently across geographies.</div>",

    question:
      "The private column in thetaxonomy looks short.Are you considering financial solutions for agricultural producersto switch to sustainable production?",
    answer:
      "<div><p>While there are many emerging sources of private funding beyond what is displayed in this taxonomy (e.g., sustainability-linked bonds), they currently contribute a relatively small portion of funding to NCS. Thus, the taxonomy reflects the largest private funding sources identified across the focus countries. Financial solutions for agricultural sustainability would be captured under the private bucket if the funding source was a private actor(e.g.,Colombian cattleranchingcompany investingin its supply chain to only producenon-deforested beef).One other factor to note isthatcompared to the public funding buckets, private funding data is harder to track given the lack of public disclosure; hence, it’s likely that all private funding estimates are an undercount.</p></div>",

    answer:
      "<div><p>There is an Excel back-up for each country with a detailed line breakdown and methodology/approach for each funding source. For the purpose of this presentation and the aggregated materials, smaller funds were consolidated. Please refer to the TNC Box drive to access this file per country.</p></div>",

    question:
      "How is confidenceof the funding estimateassessed? Are you using buckets (25%, 50%, 75%) or is it more complex than that?",
    answer:
      "<div><p>Yes, buckets are used to assess confidence level. Confidence is assessed based ondegree of assumptions needed to make estimate, if the data could be triangulated with other sources, recency and credibility/quality of the data source, and if the funding source description mentions any ties to NCS (e.g., funds reforestation efforts). Please refer to “NCS Funding Study: Methodology & Approach” deck in the TNC Box drive for further information.</p></div>",

    question:
      "Can we also assess AFOLU vs non-AFOLUfunding? E.g.,if a fund is focused on agriculture, with only 50% going to NCS and the rest going to other ag., that’s different from a general climate fund that has 50% to NCS?",
    answer:
      "<div><p>While this is an important consideration,the data available in most countriesunfortunatelydoes not lend itself to this level of granularitywithout a deeper study. However, this can beproposedas a future area of exploration for the TNC country teamsto pursue.</p></div>",

    question:
      "How do we account for the fact that some programs are funding NCS without being intended as NCS payments?(e.g.,conservation programs)",
    answer:
      "<div><p>Although NCS can be a co-benefit of other programs (e.g., conservation efforts, biodiversity programs), the NCS funding study is intended to capture funding that is allocated with the intent of achieving NCS goals.Sources with ambiguous intent were estimated as ranges basedonsecondary literature(e.g., taking the total amount of green bonds in India and applying the global percentage allocated to NCS as a proxy for amount of NCS green bonds in India), and had a lower confidence level assigned to that data point.</p></div>",

    question: "Are you analyzing funding for enforcement/oversight of NCS programs?",
    answer:
      "<div><p>It is often the case that NCS program enforcement is included instandingbudgets(e.g., a reforestation fund would include administrative and overhead costs), but we do notsplit this out in our study.</p></div>",

    question: "Have you looked into AITA for public funding?",
    answer:
      "<div><p>No; AITA was not identified as a NCS funding source in our 8 focus countries based on literature search. However, it could be a NCS funding sourcefor others.</p></div>",

    category: "NCS Funding Efficiency",
    question:
      "How is efficiency defined? Commitments vs disbursement? Is there a time horizon in this? (E.g.,not spent after X years?)",
    answer:
      "<div><p>Efficiency is definedon two dimensions: efficiency of funding allocated,and efficiency of funding being spent. Ifa government doesn't stipulate any portion of their environmental budget to NCS, this is consideredlow efficiency on the basis that very little is likely allocated to NCS projects. If the government has allocated money for reforestation effort but is practicing techniques thatdon’t maximize carbon sequestration (e.g., planting monocultures, lack of aftercare), this is also considered to have lower efficiency. Please refer to “NCS Funding Study: Methodology & Approach” deckin the Box drive for further information.</p></div>",
  },
  {
    category: null,
    question: "Can we incorporate efficiency of funding for indigenous communities?",
    answer:
      "<div><p>Given data availability, it can often be difficult to assess funding at the source level (e.g., GCF) vs. the broader funding bucket. Additionally, this study is intended as a high-level overviewof NCS funding, and therefore does not explore indigenous community funding in-depth. However, this can be proposed as a future area of exploration for the TNC country teams to pursue.</p></div>",

    question: "How is feasibility to implement of new funding sources decided? Who decides this?",

    question:
      "Are thereany positive flows that are dependent on negative flows?E.g.,in the United States, building a highway (negativeimpact) is tied to wetland banking (positive flow).",
    answer:
      "<div><p>Yes -where relevant, this is includedin thefunding study.For example, the CAMPA Fund in India is a fund generated through penalties from environmental damage to be spent on environmental restoration efforts.</p></div>",

    question:
      "Can we also identify top companies within harmful industries?That would be useful for our corporate engagement team to keep in mind when we are approached by them.",
    answer:
      "<div><p>Wheredata is available, market shareby industry is broken out to helpidentifyopportunities to engage with select corporationson NCS actions. However, where markets are highly fragmentedand the individual corporate breakdown is unavailable (e.g., agriculture in India), partnering with top companies might not be the best lever for engagement as compared to policy.</p></div>",
